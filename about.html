    <p><b>Dipayan (Dip) Nag</b> is a 4th-year undergraduate student in the faculty of science. He is a passionate individual involved in many organizations within the UVic community; and currently has ambitious plans  he hopes to bring to fruition by becoming your next Director of International Student Relations on the UVSS Board.</p> 
    <p>Born in Kolkata, India, Dip moved to the Sultanate of Oman at the age of 8. Onwards from a young age, throughout his schooling, Dip expressed keen interests in Sciences, Political consultations and Diplomacy. In particular, as he progressed through high school the Model UN political arena strongly shaped his passion as he began to see the roles politicians and diplomats play shape the world we live in. Thus, he worked hard on the areas of science and politics which culminated with graduating high school with honoured distinction.</p> 
    <p>Beginning with the Indian Student Association, Dipayan has served in many diverse roles including; Director-Social Media, Director-Administration & Legal Affairs(NISSC), Charge D'Affaires(NISSC), Director of Administration & Treasury and, most recently, President. Such a diverse range of positions, has given Dip considerable experience in community building and governance. Under his leadership a new outreach was made possible; and a new organizational structure was instituted that allowed everyone’s voices to be heard. Currently, he is finishing up his term as the President of the organization and his instrumental administrative work he is wrapping up will allow the passing of the torch and flourishing of the organization, building further upon the Indian Student Association’s 15 year legacy.</p>
    <p>For two years Dip has been recognized as Volunteer of the Year (2017 &2019), serving as one of UVic Student Ambassadors’ most distinguished members.. Within the Ambassadors, Dip has held the position of Director of Administration(2017) and Co-President(2018). Under Dip’s leadership, Recharge Day was born. Recharge day  has become a day where one day of every month, Ambassadors would get out and build Campus Spirit as well as meet students. Dip has also been involved in the implementation of the buddy program which is aimed at building community. Finally, Dip is responsible for fostering an increase in philanthropic duty of the UVic Student Ambassadors. He pioneered and garnered support from the group to donate $1000 to the UVic Student Emergency Fund. This favour was admired by the UVic community and was matched by an anonymous donor to encourage the culture of philanthropy.</p>  
    <p>Dip has been extensively involved with the Model UN Club serving on the Board for 2 terms; as Director of Fundraising & Special Events as well as Secretary-General for UVic’s Model UN conference in 2017 as well as Director-General in 2018. He has lead delegations and travelled with the club to many conferences and has been awarded at many conferences for excellence in diplomacy and building dialogue. 
    Dip has been an active volunteer and activist on UVic Campus. He was recognized by Her Campus for his service and involvement. In 2017, he was also recognized as one of seventeen peer leaders from more than 130+ delegates who attended the Youth Forum of the UN Peacekeeping Defence Ministerial, 2017, where he advised the UN and Govt of Canada on meaningful youth engagement and youth-related issues. Dip was also briefly involved in a project in support of Support Network for Indigenous Women & Women of Colour (SNIWWOC) called ‘Food with a side of Community’ which was his pleasure.
