    <h1>WHY AM I RUNNING?</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="indextext">
    <p>The three most important aspects of my campaign are advocacy for and with international students, creating a fair and affordable environment, and bringing together the international community to focus on priorities and build meaningful connections. I believe that the international community in UVic is fragmented and distant from each other. I believe uniting the voices within the community will not only help in joining our goals but will also make the priorities of the community clear.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>What has the previous board done well/not too well, and what would I do differently?</strong></p>
    <p>I want to take the work of the current board forward. Currently, the rules for fair housing needed to maintain the housing crisis in Saanich, are affecting many students, both domestic and international. However, I believe the current regulations affect international students disproportionately, as many are people of colour(POC). There have been reports of unfair restrictions placed based on biases.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The current board also has performed exceptionally on issues of divestment and making SUB greener. However, the outreach UVSS has with the student body, is something I believe that can be improved. My belief stems from the common knowledge that the SAGMs have not been meeting quorum for some time. To counteract this, I feel that involving more of our community members into the inner working of the Society, and engaging with more campus partners, will help us reach those goals.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Lastly, attention to affordability is profoundly needed. #Textbookbroke campaign has somewhat lost its momentum. Textbooks can be a real burden, and I will work and support campaigns in reducing the tremendous financial burden it places on students.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>What compelled you to run in this election?</strong></p>
    <p>The problems that I have outlined facing students, I genuinely believe are the need of the hour. I have years of experience as a leader within different communities and clubs on campus. These experiences have coalesced into giving me the confidence and political acumen to understand various organizations and policies. Ultimately, the establishment of the International Student Relations Committee was the first step, but now it has to handle a lot of the ins and outs of UVSS Policies. Policies on advocacy, UVSS outreach and affordability are vital to creating a diverse yet tight-knit community with international students and the UVic community as a whole. Thus, it is for this vision of a united and engaged community that compelled me to run in this election.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>What is the biggest issue facing students on campus, and how would you address it after elections?</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;I believe the most significant issue on the campus is the disconnect of students with organizations and between organizations themselves. There are numerous community organizations in UVic, but very few have collective events that serve the student body. However, I believe that if a forum was instituted for these groups to connect and engage each other, we could see meaningful discussion and action coming from the body.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Typically, only about 15 per cent of the student population vote in UVSS elections. How do you intend to raise student participation in student politics or events you would run on campus if elected?&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p>I have talked a lot about bringing the community together. As the international rep on the board, my goal will be to get the news out. Many international students do not know about such a position on the UVSS board and that they have the right to vote. In the past, the position became tokenized. I will remake the role with significant positive change by creating real and effective outreach into the community. Once students feel like their voices are being heard and their opinion matters, they will take an interest.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>What do you think is important for students to know about your campaign and the upcoming elections?</strong></p>
    <p>Their votes matter. It doesn&rsquo;t matter whom they vote for, but no student society can be managed in the right way if students don&rsquo;t come out and vote. UVSS represents the students and their interests. It lobbies on their behalf and attempts to make their time in UVic fruitful. Students many times, forget that they pay a significant fee to UVSS every term. UVSS uses this money to provide essential services for them and negotiates their interests in committees. Students can direct this money where it will go by exercising their right to vote; to them, I say vote!</p>
    <p><br /><br /></p>
    <p>If elected, I will work to unite voices within the international community into three core objectives:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lobbying to make tuition and MSP premiums affordable for International Students.</li>
      <li>Increasing International, People of Colour (POC), and LGBTQIA+ representation in UVSS governance.</li>
      <li>Lobbying to introduce fair housing regulations for international students.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Vote Dipayan Nag for Director of International Student Relations, on March 4th-6th! I stand&nbsp;</p>
